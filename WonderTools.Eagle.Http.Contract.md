The communication has 3 parts to it.
1. Triggering the test by the Dashboard
2. Posting the partial test report by the Node
3. Responding to the test trigger request with the full test report by the Node.


### Triggering the test by the Dashboard
1. Initiated by Dashboard
2. Handled by Node
3. URL: The URL of the node registed with the dashboard
4. Method: POST
5. Payload is as shown below
```javascript
{
  "nodeName": "name of the node",
  "id": "testid",
  "callBackUrl": "http://dashboard-callback.url",
  "requestId": "request id",
  "nodeSecret": "node secret"
}
```
* __nodeName__
It's not necessary for node to know the name of the node. This also gives the possibility of different dashboards knowing the same node by different names. The nodeName is passed by the dashboard to the node, so that node can include this in the partial and full test report

* __id__
The id of the test case or the id of the test suite that needs to be executed. When empty (""), then all the test cases in the node are executed.

* __callBackUrl__
The url of the dashboard, where the partial test results will be posted

* __requestId__
A string to that is generated by dashboard to map the request it sends to partial result call backs.

* __nodeSecret__
A secret known by the node and dashboard. When the node secret is wrong in the test trigger request, the node should respond with forbidden. This provides a safety prevents unauthorized requestors. It's also possible that node does not have a secret in a highly trusted environment. For such a node, the nodeSecret is empty ("")
